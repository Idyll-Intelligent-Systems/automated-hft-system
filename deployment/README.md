## Deployment Environments

### Development
- **Purpose**: Local development and unit testing
- **Resources**: Single node, minimal resources
- **Data**: Simulated market data
- **Monitoring**: Basic logging

### Staging  
- **Purpose**: Integration testing and validation
- **Resources**: Multi-node cluster
- **Data**: Delayed market data feeds
- **Monitoring**: Full monitoring stack

### Production
- **Purpose**: Live trading operations
- **Resources**: High-performance bare metal
- **Data**: Real-time market feeds
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 monitoring with alerting

## Container Strategy

### Core Components (Bare Metal)
- Trading engine
- Market data processor
- Risk engine
- Order management system

### Support Services (Containerized)
- Analytics services
- Monitoring stack
- Web interfaces
- Backup services

## Deployment Pipeline

```
[Git Push] → [CI/CD Pipeline] → [Testing] → [Staging] → [Production]
    ↓              ↓               ↓           ↓            ↓
[Build]    [Unit Tests]    [Integration]  [Shadow]   [Live Trading]
           [Lint/Format]   [Performance]  [Trading]   [Monitoring]
           [Security]      [Load Tests]   [Validation]
```

## Key Principles

### Zero-Downtime Deployment
- Blue-green deployments
- Rolling updates
- Health checks
- Graceful shutdowns

### Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform for infrastructure
- Ansible for configuration
- Helm for Kubernetes
- GitOps workflows

### Security
- Secret management (Vault)
- Network segmentation
- Container scanning
- Access controls

### Monitoring
- Real-time metrics
- Distributed tracing
- Log aggregation
- Alerting rules
