	•	40/100Gb Ethernet with Solarflare NICs or Mellanox hardware.
	•	FPGA-based Network Cards (e.g., Xilinx Alveo, Arista 7130).
	•	Direct exchange connections via Cross Connects or dedicated leased lines.
	•	Use low-latency switches (Arista, Cisco Nexus).
	•	Switch Port Aggregation (LAG), Link redundancy, and auto-failover.
	•	Hardware:
	•	CPU: Intel Xeon Scalable Processors, AMD EPYC series.
	•	FPGA/GPU Accelerators: Xilinx, NVIDIA A100/H100.
	•	RAM: High-frequency DDR5 (128–512 GB).
	•	Storage: NVMe SSDs (Samsung, Intel Optane).
	•	Latency Optimization:
	•	Kernel tuning: Real-time Linux kernel, Hugepages.
	•	Disable interrupt coalescing; CPU Affinity settings (NUMA, taskset).
	•	Use DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit) for fast packet processing.
